# UFOs
## Overview of Project/Purpose
After creating a UFO Sightings webpage in the module with a filter that separated the sightings by date, it was determined that more in-depth analysis was needed.  This analysis was to be provided by allowing users/visitors to the webpage the ability to filter for multiple criteria along with the sighting date.  Table filters were added to the website for the city sighting, state sighting, country sighting, and shape of UFO.  These multiple filters can all be used at the same time.

## Results
In order to use the search filter/criteria one would first have to open the UFO sightings webpage, which in my case is (file:///C:/Users/Ashok/OneDrive/Desktop/Data%20Boot%20Camp%20Class%20Folder/UFOs/index.html).  Each search filter can be used by entering the specific data relative to that filter and then pressing enter on the keyboard to display the results in the table.

For example, when entering the date in the "Enter Date" filter we would have to enter the date in the date/month/year (1/10/2010) format.  A placeholder will be found inside the filter box which can help the user enter the correct format.  After pressing enter, the results will be displyed.  For example, when entering the date 1/13/2010, the results will display as shown in the following image.
