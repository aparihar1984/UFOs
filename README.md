## Overview of Project/Purpose
After creating a UFO Sightings webpage in the module with a filter that filtered the sightings by date, it was determined that more in-depth analysis was needed.  This analysis was to be provided by allowing users/visitors to the webpage the ability to filter for multiple criteria along with the sighting date.  Table filters were added to the website for the city sighting, state sighting, country sighting, and shape of UFO sighting.  These multiple filters can all be used at the same time.

## Results
In order to use the search filter/criteria, one would first have to open the UFO sightings webpage in the google chrome app which in my case is the index.html.  Each search filter can be used by entering the specific data relative to that filter and then pressing enter on the keyboard to display the results in the table.

For example, when entering the date in the "Enter Date" filter we would have to enter the date in the day/month/year (1/10/2010) format.  A placeholder is present inside the filter box which helps the user enter the correct format.  After pressing enter, the results will be displyed.  

When entering the date "1/13/2010", the displayed results will appear as shown in the following image:

When entering the city in the "Enter City" filter we would have to enter the city by it's full name and all in small caps.  A placeholder is present inside the filter box which helps the user enter the correct format.  After pressing enter, the results will be displyed.  

When entering the city Bonita as "bonita", the displayed results will appear as shown in the following image:

When entering the state in the "Enter State" filter we would have to enter the state by it's abbreviation and in small caps.  A placeholder is present inside the filter box which helps the user enter the correct format.  After pressing enter, the results will be displyed.  

When entering the state of California as "ca", the displayed results will appear as shown in the following image:

When entering the country in the "Enter Country" filter we would have to enter the country by it's abbreviation and in small caps.  A placeholder is present inside the filter box which helps the user enter the correct format.  After pressing enter, the results will be displyed.  

When entering the country of Canada as "ca", the displayed results will appear as shown in the following image:

When entering the shape in the "Enter Shape" filter we would have to enter the shape by it's full name and in small caps.  A placeholder is present inside the filter box which helps the user enter the correct format.  After pressing enter, the results will be displyed.  

When entering the shape "circle", the displayed results will appear as shown in the following image:

One can also use multiple search filters/criteria at the same time.  For example, when entering the date "1/1/2010" and the city "el cajon" the displayed results will appear as shown in the following image:

## Summary
One drawback to this webpage is that in order to enter the state or the country in their respective search filters, one would have to know the abbreviation for each state or country.  If there is a state or country who's abbreviation the user is unaware of, then using the search filter becomes more difficult.  

Perhaps a solution to this problem would be to have the respective state and country search filter feature a drop down menu with all the abbreviations listed inside.  The user would then get to choose which state or country they want to search for.  To make things even easier the drop down menu could have the abbreviation along with the corresponding state or country's full spelling next to the abbreviation.  While this would take more coding, it can be done.
